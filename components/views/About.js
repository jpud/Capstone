    <h2><u>NASA</u></h2>
    <p>
      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent
      agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civilian space
      program, as well as aeronautics and space research. NASA was established
      in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
      (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation,
      encouraging peaceful applications in space science. Since its
      establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
      including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and
      later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space
      Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the
      Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar
      Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch
      Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and
      countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches. NASA's science is focused
      on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;
      advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission
      Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout
      the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons;
      and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the
      Great Observatories and associated programs.
