    <h2><u>The "Unicorn" Black Hole</u></h2>
    <p>
      The closest known black hole to Earth, a weirdly tiny object dubbed "The
      Unicorn" that lurks just 1,500 light-years from us. The nickname has a
      double meaning. Not only does the black hole candidate reside in the
      constellation Monoceros ("the unicorn"), its incredibly low mass — about
      three times that of the sun — makes it nearly one of a kind. "Because the
      system is so unique and so weird, you know, it definitely warranted the
      nickname of 'The Unicorn,'" discovery team leader Tharindu Jayasinghe, an
      astronomy Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University, said in a new video
      the school made to explain the find. "The Unicorn" has a companion — a
      bloated red giant star that's nearing the end of its life. (Our sun will
      swell up as a red giant in about five billion years.) That companion has
      been observed by a variety of instruments over the years, including the
      All Sky Automated Survey and NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.
      Jayasinghe and his colleagues analyzed that big dataset and noticed
      something interesting: The red giant's light shifts in intensity
      periodically, suggesting that another object is tugging on the star and
      changing its shape. The team determined that the object doing the tugging
      is likely a black hole — one harboring a mere three solar masses, based on
      details of the star's velocity and the light distortion. (For perspective:
      The supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy packs
      about 4.3 million solar masses.) "Just as the moon's gravity distorts the
      Earth's oceans, causing the seas to bulge toward and away from the moon,
      producing high tides, so does the black hole distort the star into a
      football-like shape with one axis longer than the other," study co-author
      Todd Thompson, chair of Ohio State's astronomy department, said in a
      statement. "The simplest explanation is that it's a black hole — and in
      this case, the simplest explanation is the most likely one." That
      explanation, likely though it may be, is not set in stone; "The Unicorn"
      remains a black hole candidate at the moment.

    <h2><u>Dark Matter</u></h2>
    <p>
      Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter thought to account for
      approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. Dark matter is called
      "dark" because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic
      field, which means it does not absorb, reflect, or emit electromagnetic
      radiation (like light) and is, therefore, difficult to detect. Various
      astrophysical observations — including gravitational effects which cannot
      be explained by currently accepted theories of gravity unless more matter
      is present than can be seen — imply dark matter's presence. For this
      reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe
      and has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. The primary
      evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many
      galaxies would behave quite differently if they did not contain a large
      amount of unseen matter. Some galaxies would not have formed at all and
      others would not move as they currently do. Other lines of evidence
      include observations in gravitational lensing and the cosmic microwave
      background, along with astronomical observations of the observable
      universe's current structure, the formation and evolution of galaxies,
      mass location during galactic collisions, and the motion of galaxies
      within galaxy clusters. In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the
      total mass-energy content of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and
      energy, 27% dark matter, and 68% of a form of energy known as dark energy.
      Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total mass, while dark energy and
      dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass-energy content. Because no
      one has directly observed dark matter yet – assuming it exists – it must
      barely interact with ordinary baryonic matter and radiation except through
      gravity. Most dark matter is thought to be non-baryonic; it may be
      composed of some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particles. The primary
      candidate for dark matter is some new kind of elementary particle that has
      not yet been discovered, particularly weakly interacting massive particles
      (WIMPs), though axions have drawn renewed attention due to the
      non-detection of WIMPs in experiments. Many experiments to directly detect
      and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none
      have yet succeeded. Dark matter is classified as "cold," "warm," or "hot"
      according to its velocity (more precisely, its free streaming length).
      Current models favor a cold dark matter scenario, in which structures
      emerge by the gradual accumulation of particles. Although the scientific
      community generally accepts dark matter's existence, some astrophysicists,
      intrigued by specific observations that are not well-explained by ordinary
      dark matter, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of
      general relativity. These include modified Newtonian dynamics,
      tensor–vector–scalar gravity, or entropic gravity. These models attempt to
      account for all observations without invoking supplemental non-baryonic
      matter.

    <h2><u>The Webb Telescope</u></h2>
    <p>
      The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed
      primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. The most powerful telescope ever
      launched into space, its greatly improved infrared resolution and
      sensitivity will allow it to view objects too old, distant, and faint for
      the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of
      investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as
      observations of first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and
      detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.
      JWST was launched December 25, 2021 on an ESA Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou,
      French Guiana, and as of April 2022 is undergoing testing and alignment.
      Once operational, expected in May 2022, JWST is intended to succeed the
      Hubble as NASA's flagship mission in astrophysics. The U.S. National
      Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's development in
      collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space
      Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland
      managed telescope development, the Space Telescope Science Institute in
      Baltimore operates JWST, and the prime contractor was Northrop Grumman.
      The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of
      NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.
      JWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of
      gold-plated beryllium which combined create a 6.5-meter (21 ft) diameter
      mirror, compared to Hubble's 2.4 m (7.9 ft). This gives the Webb telescope
      a light-collecting area about 25 square meters, about 6 times that of
      Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet, visible,
      and near infrared (0.1–1.7 μm) spectra, JWST will observe in a lower
      frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through
      mid-infrared (0.6–28.3 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold,
      below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), to observe faint signals in the infrared
      without interference from other sources of warmth. It is deployed in a
      solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million
      kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five layer kite-shaped
      sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.
      Development began in 1996 for a launch initially planned for 2007 with a
      US$500 million budget. There were many delays and cost overruns, including
      a major redesign in 2005, a ripped sunshield during a practice deployment,
      recommendations from an independent review board, a threat by the U.S.
      Congress to cancel the project, the COVID-19 pandemic, and problems with
      the telescope itself. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the
      telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists and
      engineers. Construction was completed in late 2016, followed by years of
      extensive testing before launch. The total project cost is now expected to
      be about US$9.7 billion.

    <h2><u>Planet GJ 1214 b</u></h2>
    <p>
      Gliese 1214 b (often shortened to GJ 1214 b) is an exoplanet that orbits
      the star Gliese 1214, and was discovered in December 2009. Its parent star
      is 48 light-years from the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. As of
      2017, GJ 1214 b is the most likely known candidate for being an ocean
      planet. For that reason, scientists have nicknamed the planet "the
      waterworld". It is a super-Earth, meaning it is larger than Earth but is
      significantly smaller (in mass and radius) than the gas giants of the
      Solar System. After COROT-7b, it was the second super-Earth to be known
      and is the first of a new class of planets with small size and relatively
      low density. GJ 1214 b is also significant because its parent star is
      relatively near the Sun and because it transits (crosses in front of) that
      parent star, which allows the planet's atmosphere to be studied using
      spectroscopic methods. In December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may
      have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214 b. The radius of GJ 1214 b
      can be inferred from the amount of dimming seen when the planet crosses in
      front of its parent star as viewed from Earth. The mass of the planet can
      be inferred from sensitive observations of the parent star's radial
      velocity, measured through small shifts in stellar spectral lines due to
      the Doppler effect. Given the planet's mass and radius, its density can be
      calculated. Through a comparison with theoretical models, the density in
      turn provides limited but highly useful information about the composition
      and structure of the planet. Due to the relatively small size of GJ 1214
      b's parent star, it is feasible to perform spectroscopic observations
      during planetary transits. By comparing the observed spectrum before and
      during transits, the spectrum of the planetary atmosphere can be inferred.
      In December 2010, a study was published showing the spectrum to be largely
      featureless over the wavelength range of 750–1000 nm. Because a thick and
      cloud-free hydrogen-rich atmosphere would have produced detectable
      spectral features, such an atmosphere appears to be ruled out. Although no
      clear signs were observed of water vapor or any other molecule, the
      authors of the study believe the planet may have an atmosphere composed
      mainly of water vapor. Another possibility is that there may be a thick
      layer of high clouds, which absorbs the starlight. Because of the
      estimated old age of the planetary system and the calculated hydrodynamic
      escape (loss of gasses that tends to deplete an atmosphere of higher
      molecular-weight constituents) rate of 900 tonnes per second, scientists
      conclude that there has been a significant atmospheric loss during the
      lifetime of the planet and any current atmosphere cannot be primordial.
      The loss of primordial atmosphere was indirectly confirmed in 2020 as no
      helium was detected at Gliese 1214 b. Helium was detected in the
      atmosphere of Gliese 1214 b by 2022 though. GJ 1214 b may be cooler than
      any other known transiting planet prior to the discovery of Kepler-16b in
      2011 by the Kepler mission. Its equilibrium temperature is believed to be
      in the range of 393–555 K (120–282 °C; 248–539 °F), depending on how much
      of the star's radiation is reflected into space.

    <h2><u>KIC 846285</u></h2>
    <p>
      Tabby's Star (also known as Boyajian's Star and WTF Star, and designated
      KIC 8462852 in the Kepler Input Catalog) is an F-type main-sequence star
      in the constellation Cygnus approximately 1,470 light-years (450 pc) from
      Earth. Unusual light fluctuations of the star, including up to a 22%
      dimming in brightness, were discovered by citizen scientists as part of
      the Planet Hunters project. In September 2015, astronomers and citizen
      scientists associated with the project posted a preprint of an article
      describing the data and possible interpretations. The discovery was made
      from data collected by the Kepler space telescope, which observed changes
      in the brightness of distant stars to detect exoplanets. Several
      hypotheses have been proposed to explain the star's large irregular
      changes in brightness as measured by its light curve, but none to date
      fully explain all aspects of the curve. One explanation is that an "uneven
      ring of dust" orbits Tabby's Star. In another explanation, the star's
      luminosity is modulated by changes in the efficiency of heat transport to
      its photosphere, so no external obscuration is required. A third
      hypothesis, based on a lack of observed infrared light, posits a swarm of
      cold, dusty comet fragments in a highly eccentric orbit; however, the
      notion that disturbed comets from such a cloud could exist in high enough
      numbers to obscure 22% of the star's observed luminosity has been doubted.
      Another hypothesis is that a large number of small masses in "tight
      formation" are orbiting the star. Furthermore, spectroscopic study of the
      system has found no evidence for coalescing material or hot close-in dust
      or circumstellar matter from an evaporating or exploding planet within a
      few astronomical units of the mature central star. It has also been
      hypothesized that the changes in brightness could be signs of activity
      associated with intelligent extraterrestrial life constructing a Dyson
      swarm; however, further analysis based on data through the end of 2017
      showed wavelength-dependent dimming consistent with dust but not an opaque
      object such as an alien megastructure, which would block all wavelengths
      of light equally. Tabby's Star is not the only star that has large
      irregular dimmings, but other such stars include young stellar objects
      called YSO dippers, which have different dimming patterns. An example of
      such an object is EPIC 204278916.] New fluctuations ran from mid-May 2017
      until July 2018, assuming their continuance in late-December 2017 to
      mid-February 2018 when obscured by the Sun. In September 2019, astronomers
      reported that the observed dimmings of Tabby's Star may have been produced
      by fragments resulting from the disruption of an orphaned exomoon. An
      overall study of other similar stars has been presented. In January 2021,
      a distant stellar-mass companion was reported, making Tabby's Star a
      binary stellar system.
